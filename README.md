# FSA LFP Counties Archive

This repository is an archive of the county boundary dataset used to
determine USDA [Livestock Forage Disaster Program
(LFP)](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/programs/livestock-forage-disaster-program-lfp)
eligibility.

Each week, eligibility for the LFP is determined for each county in the
United States. Federal law and FSA guidance describes a process by which
[county-level
eligibility](https://sustainable-fsa.github.io/fsa-lfp-eligibility/) is
determined by the intersection of county boundaries, the [United States
Drought Monitor weekly drought
assessment](https://sustainable-fsa.github.io/usdm/), and the [normal
grazing
period](https://sustainable-fsa.github.io/fsa-normal-grazing-period/)
for each type of grazing land in each county.

[Official county boundaries
change](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.html),
both substantially as counties and county equivalents are created and
removed as well as in small ways as legal boundaries between counties
are refined. For instance, the US Census has recorded 472 county
boundary corrections or changes from 2008 through 2024. Thus, agencies
that make regulatory actions which implicate county boundaries (such as
LFP eligibility determination) *must* maintain records of which
boundaries were used for such determinations. LFP eligibility
determinations stipulate that if ‚Äúany area of the county‚Äù falls within
certain drought classes during a type of crop‚Äôs normal grazing period
eligibility is triggered. County boundary definitions are essential to
the administration of the LFP.

> For more information on determining eligibility for the LFP, refer to
> [FSA Guidance document 1-LFP Amendment 6, Paragraph
> 23A](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1lfp-a6.pdf).

The data in this repository were acquired via FOIA request
**2025-FSA-08431-F** by R. Kyle Bocinsky (Montana Climate Office) and
fulfilled on August 4, 2025. The FOIA response, including the original
Esri file geodatabase, is archived in the [`foia`](./foia) directory.

## FOIA Final Response

During the process of refining the FOIA request, the FSA LFP Program
Owner revealed that the geospatial county eligibility determination is
not performed by USDA staff, but instead is performed by the National
Drought Mitigation Center under contract to the USDA Office of the Chief
Economist. The ‚ÄúProgram Owner‚Äù for an FSA program is a senior official
or department within the agency responsible for a specific farm or loan
program. On August 11, 2025, seeking clarification about the request,
the Program Owner said:

> FSA does not use a county boundary to determine LFP eligibility. FSA
> and the USDM use a tabular file of counties, states, and grazing
> periods established for specific pasture types in conjunction with
> *drought data received from the USDM by physical state and county*, no
> boundary files are used. \[Emphasis added\]

Accordingly, Bocinsky requested that the Program Owner contact the USDM
and request the geospatial county boundary data used for the county
drought determinations, including how those data have changed through
time and any computer scripts or protocols used when making that
determination.

In the FOIA Final Response, received on September 4, 2025, the Program
Owner provided a geospatial counties dataset from the National Drought
Mitigation Center, who produces the USDM. The FOIA response also
provided the following explanation:

> In response to your request, we compiled and are releasing in full,
> the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC)s geodatabase that
> contains the current county boundaries. According to the program
> owner, the boundaries are from the ESRI dataset from 2008 and are
> considered the industry standard for all geopolitical boundaries and
> reference layers. The NDMC obtained these layers prior to the 2008
> Farm Bill first that included relief programs associated with the USDM
> as county level statistics and maps were available when the transition
> to GIS map development took place. The NDMC uses this data to have a
> consistent value for the various counties that have not changed since
> they were first incorporated in 2008. The NDMC has had to update some
> counties during this time due to changes made in redrawing and/or
> renaming counties and with new FIPS creations. The last such change
> being in 2021 that included an Alaska boundary change. This was a
> relatively simple change as Alaska doesn‚Äôt touch any other states with
> the updates not affecting the rest of the United States. The other
> most recent change was in 2019 that included a county name and FIPS
> change in South Dakota and that did not require a geometry change. The
> next anticipated changes that will be required are in Connecticut due
> to a redraw and renaming of their county level jurisdictions that were
> initiated at the state level. This change will be made within the
> existing detailed boundaries and shapefiles of these new jurisdiction
> units. We will be redrawing the internal boundaries based on the best
> available data, either from the U.S. Census, the state of Connecticut,
> or commercial (ESRI) sources and the NDMC will need to work directly
> with USDA to determine exactly how these will be implemented with
> regards to programs triggered by the USDM. This process has been our
> standard for updating changing geometry in base datasets that are used
> in the weekly calculations. All the data utilized in the weekly
> calculations are freely available on the United States Drought Monitor
> website under the ‚Äúdata‚Äù tab:
> <https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Data.aspx>. The final data are updated
> each week during the official release of the USDM map and associated
> statistics and data information. These data are also the same data
> utilized in the making of the North American Drought Monitor. The NDMC
> is the official home and archive of all the data, maps, and
> information related to the United States Drought Monitor, and all this
> information is freely available at <https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/>.

Given the pronouns used in this narrative, it was most likely written by
NDMC staff.

### Considerations

A few considerations should be noted:

1.  The Program Owner states, ‚Äúthe boundaries are from the ESRI dataset
    from 2008 and are considered the industry standard for all
    geopolitical boundaries and reference layers.‚Äù Esri is the company
    that makes the ArcGIS software platform used by the NDMC for
    geospatial processing and analysis. There is no single dataset that
    would be considered an Esri counties dataset; rather, this likely
    refers to a county boundary data that Esri provided prior to 2008.
    While Esri software and the ArcGIS platform could arguably be called
    the ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù, the counties dataset to which the Program
    Owner is referring is of unknown origin and provenance.

2.  Furthermore, ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù does not necessarily mean ‚Äúfederal
    standard‚Äù. The county boundaries in this dataset differ
    substantially from those of the US Census county boundary dataset,
    the authoritative county boundaries of the United States.

3.  The intersection of counties and USDM drought class polygons happens
    on a weekly basis. In their response, Program Owner acknowledges
    that the counties dataset used by the NDMC for this process have
    been updated since 2008, but there is only one file provided (the
    ‚Äúcurrent county boundaries‚Äù). It is unclear whether archives of past
    versions of the FSA LFP county dataset exist.

## üì• Input Data: FOIA Esri File Geodatabase

The FOIA response contains annual NGP data from **2008 through 2024**
for each pasture type, county, and program year.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Description |
|----|----|
| `Program Year` | Year the data applies to |
| `State Name` | U.S. state |
| `County Name` | County or county-equivalent name |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üßπ Processing Workflow

The processing script
[`fsa-normal-grazing-period.R`](./fsa-normal-grazing-period.R):

1.  **Unzips and reads** the Excel workbook.
2.  **Filters records** with missing dates.
3.  **Constructs an `FSA Code`** by concatenating state and county FSA
    codes.
4.  **Cleans and standardizes** pasture type names.
5.  **Corrects known data errors**, including:

- Erroneous years and dates in KS, UT, MS, and MT records.
- Handling duplicate and misassigned counties (e.g., Shoshone County,
  ID).

6.  **Removes invalid or duplicate entries**.
7.  **Exports** the cleaned data to
    [`fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv`](./fsa-normal-grazing-period.csv).
8.  **Renders** an interactive Quarto dashboard.

## üß≠ About FSA County Codes

The USDA FSA uses custom county definitions that differ from standard
ANSI/FIPS codes used by the U.S. Census. To align the Normal Grazing
Period data with geographic boundaries, we use the FSA-specific
geospatial dataset archived in the companion repository:

üîó
[**sustainable-fsa/fsa-counties-dd17**](https://sustainable-fsa.github.io/fsa-counties-dd17/)

FSA county codes are documented in [FSA Handbook 1-CM, Exhibit
101](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1-cm_r03_a80.pdf).
